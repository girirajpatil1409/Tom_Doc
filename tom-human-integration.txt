## Minimal Human Integration

While TOM is designed for maximum autonomy, the system initially requires these configuration inputs:

1. **Initial Setup & Account Access**
   - Platform API credentials and authentication
   - Basic brand guidelines for content boundaries
   - Initial market focus selection
   - Hardware deployment specifications

2. **System Boundaries**
   - Maximum risk tolerance parameters
   - Content category exclusions
   - Monetization method limitations

3. **Monitoring Options**
   - Preferred reporting cadence (daily/weekly/monthly)
   - Alert thresholds for exceptional events
   - Automated intervention triggers

After initial configuration, TOM is designed to operate with zero human input, making all strategic and tactical decisions autonomously while delivering passive income.
