TOM v1.0.0 is an autonomous social media empire builder implementing these mathematical optimization systems:
1. Platform Diversification Algorithm - Detects algorithm changes and optimizes cross-platform resilience
2. Content Portfolio Optimization - Balances evergreen/trending content using portfolio theory
3. Revenue Sensitivity Analysis - Models revenue factors and implements contingency triggers
4. Pattern Recognition Engine - Identifies success patterns and predicts content performance
5. Economic Adaptation System - Adjusts strategies based on economic conditions

The goal is achieving complete autonomy as quickly as possible while maximizing revenue potential.
